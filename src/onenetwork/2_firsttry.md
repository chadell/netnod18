## Typical IT ecosystem

## How the network looks like

## Downsides

* By default, inter/intra platform communications use <span style="color:yellow">Internet</span> which is not (always) the most <span style="color:yellow">performant, secure and cheapest</span> communication channel
* Manual network provisioning doesnâ€™t work in terms of <span style="color:yellow">speed and reliability</span>
* Prone to <span style="color:yellow">errors</span> and lack of consistency
* Some communications still need <span style="color:yellow">network layer security</span> (no TLS)

## We tried to solve <span style="color:yellow">all in one</span>

##  ... and we <span style="color:yellow">failed</span>

## (non-technical) Lessons learned

* Think as your <span style="color:yellow">users</span> will do
* Get <span style="color:yellow">feedback</span> as soon as possible, iterate!
* The solution should <span style="color:yellow">flexible</span> enough to accommodate several underlying solutions
* Evaluate <span style="color:yellow">current</span> needs case-per-case (capability, performance, cost, etc.)
* Apply Pareto Rule, <span style="color:yellow">focus</span> on solving most urgent first
