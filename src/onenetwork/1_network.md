## <span style="color:yellow">Networking</span> nowadays

## <span style="color:yellow">Challenges</span>

<div id="left">

* Scalability
* Containerisation
* Distributed Systems
* Multi-platform
* High Performance applications
* Efficiency

</div>

<div id="right">

<span style="color:yellow">Traditional</span> network architectures/operations are not good enough

</div>

## Are we ready?

* Multi-vendor with <span style="color:yellow">legacy</span> devices not well-suited for automation
* There is a lot of <span style="color:yellow">new things to learn</span>
* Vendor <span style="color:yellow">trainings</span> aren’t (weren’t) focused on this
* Automation <span style="color:yellow">amplify</span> everything (including mistakes)
* Usually, <span style="color:yellow">not close to developers</span>, to the business

And most of the times, <span style="color:yellow">we don’t know where to start from...</span>

## How can we approach it?

* <span style="color:yellow">APIs everywhere</span>, your network devices should support them
* Use <span style="color:yellow">Data Models</span>, they will help you translate your will
* Take advantage of the <span style="color:yellow">information</span> your network is providing
* Don't fear <span style="color:yellow">dynamic infrastructure</span>
* Some <span style="color:yellow">coding skills</span> will be needed
* Validate, validate and <span style="color:yellow">validate</span> again

Start by solving simple problems... keeping <span style="color:yellow">applications</span> on your line of sight
